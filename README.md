This is an application created using Kotlin to enable easy registration, checking-in and checking-out of kids in Kids Sunday school classes
More features include sending SMS to parents when the child has been checked out which currently uses an `sms gateway` app fot handling the sms
but will switch to `infobit` for a more reliable easy to handle sms experience
